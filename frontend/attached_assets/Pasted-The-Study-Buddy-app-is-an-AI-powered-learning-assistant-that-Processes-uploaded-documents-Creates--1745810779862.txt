The Study Buddy app is an AI-powered learning assistant that:

Processes uploaded documents
Creates personalized quizzes and flashcards
Offers interactive tutoring sessions
Tracks learning progress
Provides guided study sessions with varied learning activities

The backend is already built with FastAPI and uses advanced AI models to generate educational content.
